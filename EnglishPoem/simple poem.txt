In The Name Of Allah
 
We seek Allah's protection
From Shaitan evil mind;
And begin with the name of Allah
Most Merciful, Most Kind!

Allah is Great
 
Allah is Great this I know,
For the Qur'an tells me so;
All of us to him belong,
We are weak but he is strong.
 
Allah is One
Related to none
Allah is One!
No father, no mother
No sister, no brother
No daughter, no son
Allah is One!

We Thank you Allah
 
For All the things
we have today;
for all our friends
we love so much
for home, for food
for work and play,
we thank you,
Oh Allah.
